    In these maps it is possible to choose between displaying records from all publicly accessible NBN datasets
    or just those from datasets supplied to the NBN by the Earthworm Society of Britain (ESB). The
    latter are verified by the ESB. Select the provenance of the records from the drop-down on the right directly above the map.
