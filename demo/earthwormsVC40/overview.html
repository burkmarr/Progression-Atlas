    The FSC Tomorrow's Biodiversity project is working in association with the 
    Earthworm Society of Britain (ESB) to promote earthworm recording in the UK. 
    We have produced this online mapping tool that presents
    the distribution maps for the vice county of Shropshire (VC40). 
    The main purpose is to 
    enable current recorders
    to target their efforts on the ground in order to fill in the gaps.
</p>
<p>
    The records for these maps are periodically downloaded from the NBN Gateway. Most of
    the earthworm records on the NBN Gateway are publicly accessible. The most important
    datasets are those supplied by the ESB. These are fully publicly accessible at full
    resolution. On these maps it is possible to view records from ESB datasets on their
    own. Records from the ESB are verified.

<p>
    This dialog includes instructions on using the mapping tool but, for the most part, you
    can learn about it just by playing with it.

    If you have ideas on how this tool could be improved to give you more useful information
    as a contributor to earthworm recording, please let us know:

    Anyone can get involved in recording earthworms in the UK.
